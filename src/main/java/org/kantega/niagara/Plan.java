/**
 * A Plan is a description of the streaming steps to perform. It is "compiled" into a runnable block by build. Nothing is done
 * before the block is actually run. When the stream ends no traces of the stream exist other than the performed sideeffects.
 * The plan has to be compiled and run again if
 * the stream is to be rerun.
 * <p>
 * To extend the stream api you can subtype Plan and add methods that use append to add operational stages to the source.
 * <p>
 * A plan is immutable. Every call to build creates a new and separate stream. Take caution when pulling data from queues or other
 * data from outside the stream, as they are mutable and change between and during streams.
 * The qeueues for example are not immutable
